Mission and principles
----------------------

Our mission is to make the Sanskrit tradition radically accessible.
Specifically, we have three goals:

1. Create a comprehensive archive of traditional Sanskrit literature.

2. Publish this archive in an open format.

3. Integrate this archive with intelligent tools.

All three of goals are different faces of the same principle of *radical
access*. And we mention that principle here, in our technical docs, because
that principle influences our technical design as well.

From a project perspective, radical access means that we communicate openly and
visibly about our project, whether that's through mailing lists, through
Discord, or through GitHub issues. It means that we include and welcome anyone
who wants to contribute to our mission.

From a code perspective, radical access means that we build in public so that
anyone can see how our project is doing and participate themselves. It means
that we bias toward obvious and boring technology that anyone can read and
understand. And it means that we take care to write code that is clear and
simple.

From a data perspective, radical access means that we rely on open and public
data and produce open and public data in return. Although licensing rights
often prevent it, we strive to release our texts under a `CC0`_ (public domain)
license.
