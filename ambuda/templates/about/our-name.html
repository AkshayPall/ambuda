<h1>Our Name</h1>

<p>In July 2013, we prototyped a website where people could collaboratively
transcribe Sanskrit texts. Since the platform would store texts in a digital
cloud and create texts from a metaphorical cloud of human activity, we called
the project "Ambuda," which is one of the many Sanskrit words for "cloud."

<p>Work ended on that prototype two weeks later, and little of it survives
today. But when we started work on the project you see before you now, we
needed a name, and we were happy to reuse the name "Ambuda" and move on.

<p>Although we chose this name purely out of convenience, it has an unexpected
resonance ({{ 'dhvani' | devanagari }}) that makes it well-suited to this
project.

<p>As a practical matter, "Ambuda" is short and memorable, and it was available
as a domain name. It is non-sectarian and easy for people around the world to
spell correctly. On these grounds alone, it is a fine name.

<p>As a Sanskrit word, it is delightful to the ear and has some nice
properties. As Krishna says in the <cite>Bhagavad Gita</cite>, <q>Of sounds, I
am <i>a</i>.</q> Thus Ambuda starts auspiciously from its very first sound.

<p>As a poetic symbol, the cloud is rich and evocative. The clouds mark the
beginning of the monsoon season and bring life-giving rain to the parched land.
Those weary travelers who see them long for home and for reunion with the ones
they love.

<p>Even more could be said, but we trust you get the idea.
